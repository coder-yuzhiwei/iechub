If you are reporting a bug or problem with MITIE then fill out the entire template below.  Issues asking questions about why something doesn't work that fail to fill out the entire template will be closed.

Also, **the issue tracker is not a code writing service, do not ask for someone to write code for you.**  In particular, do not submit issues asking for feature improvements to the example programs.  The examples are documentation, their purpose is to teach, not to be useful programs.  **If there is some feature improvement you want in an example program then it's up to you to write it**.  

If you aren't reporting a bug or problem with MITIE then delete this template and write whatever you want here.
